hello! This a Description about what i learnt in my workshop where i learnt about fundamentals of azure :)
what is clod computing?
The simple explanation is Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet
we can pay for the resource like storage application ,processing power without having to manage physical hardware
here are some merits of it:
1) scalability - ( i find it really fascinating) so basically we can scale up/down the resource according to the demand
2) Accessiblity- we can access it from anywhere
here is one Real time applications/Casestudy:
1)snapchat , azure helps with the infrastructure , engagement and high availability
   There are three different type of cloud services
   1)Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
   2) Platform as a structure(PaaS)
   3) Software as a service(Saas)
*Hybrid cloud= public+private cloud= we can manage who can use/have access
*public cloud=available for everyone
There is two type of region
1) reccommended region- where majority of the services will be available
2) Alternate region
   *Sovereign regions- These regions are goverenedby certain rules and these are isolated from maitanece of azure
   Azure resource: Each and every component in azure is a azure resource
   Resource group: this is a container which holds all the resources
   HERE IS STEPS TO CREATE THE RESOURCE GROUP:
   1) Go to azure portal login
   2)
